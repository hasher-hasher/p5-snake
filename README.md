### Snake

Snake game made for fun using [P5.js](https://p5js.org).
For reference, i used [Code Train Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM) with modifications.

I made it available to play on my [Codepen page](https://codepen.io/hasher/pen/VGrdPa)
If you want to test, import P5.js to a html file and next import sketch.js. Enjoy!

I had a lot of fun doing :heartpulse:
